## Pystagram

This app aims to clone a few features that instagram does. Mainly a user will login into the app and be able to upload an image to the database. This will instantly show up on the feed in the order submitted. Since the user base is tiny the app will have one feed to post. I would like to add a comment section and like button for the images. Authentication and collections withing collections must exist for this app to work. It will be challenge for sure.
